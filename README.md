The communication between the web server and hardware device is established via GSM/GPRS shield, and the location is traced by using the GPS shield. The accident is detected through accelerometer, keypad and buzzer. The project is developed for real time data fetching form the hardware device using sensors and store in the web server, and send notification to different users either through web application, SMS.
